# Rust meetups around the world

A map of Rust meetups around the world.
Initial data fetched from [Meetup.com's list of Rust meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/rust/all/).
Based on the [Tech Speakers Map](https://mte90.github.io/Tech-Speakers-Map/) by [Mte90](https://github.com/Mte90).

## How to use

The initial data import is done by a small web scraper.
It is not yet published or documented. This will follow.

There's currently no process of adding new meetups (as we might want to scrape meetup.com automatically from time to time).
With the current format it is possible to add non-Meetup.com meetups as well.
